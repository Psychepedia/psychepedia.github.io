## Synopsis

Psychepedia is evidence-based and process-driven. Information is presented as a series of steps with clearly defined objectives, qualifications, resources, and evidence. There are two types of documents: Guides and Resources. Guides are process-driven while resources are ancillary material. This document provides guidelines for the formatting, editing, and inclusion of content. All content on Psychepedia is subject to the [Creative Commons Zero License.](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)

# Process

## Install the Github Writer Extension

This Chrome extension will provide a [WYSIWYG editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) for modifying [Github .md files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes). The extension will make it easier to format documents in the Chrome browser. Optionally, you can use [Github Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) instead.

1.  Install the [Github Writer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-writer/diilnnhpcdjhhkjcbdljaonhmhapadap)
2.  Navigate to a `.md` file such as this one
3.  Click the Edit pencil icon
4.  Confirm that the extension is working when the editing toolbar appears

## Edit an Existing Document

1.  Navigate to the appropriate folder in the [Psychepedia repository on Github](https://github.com/myxeliumcom/Psychepedia)
2.  Click the `Edit` pencil icon
3.  Make edits

2.  Click `Add file` button
3.  Title the file and conclude the file with the `.md` extension
    1.  The file will become a URL. Therefore, use `_` instead of spaces and do not include non-standard characters
4.  [Commit & review changes](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project)
    1.  This creates the document and will enable the Github Writer extension upon editing (of a `.md` file)
5.  Click the `Edit` pencil icon
6.  Create a branch for the commit and start a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

## Begin Each Document With Background Info

1.  [Create a table](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables) or copy the Guide Document Template
2.  Fill in the table's information as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><td>Role</td><td>Who this guide is for. i.e., Journeyer, Practitioner, or Operator</td></tr><tr><td>Phase</td><td>The phase of the journey. i.e., Preparation, Journey, or Integration</td></tr><tr><td>Qualifications</td><td>What is necessary to undertake this guide. e.g., prior reading, a prior experience, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Objectives</td><td>What are the promises of undertaking this guide. e.g., develop trust and surrender to allow the Inner Healing Intelligence to do its work with the least friction.</td></tr><tr><td>Resources</td><td>Additional resources. e.g., books, websites, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Linked to</td><td>Links to other documents in Psychepedia</td></tr><tr><td>Linked from</td><td>Links from other documents in Psychepedia</td></tr></tbody></table>

Â  3. Add a synopsis that describes what the guide details under a Synopsis [header 2](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Format Guide Documents as Processes and Steps

Guides are formatted as actionable steps that begin with verbs. Background information can be provided as sub-points in each step.

1.  Title each process with a [header 2](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
2.  Provide background information for the process
    1.  Background information can include objectives, resources, and other information relevant to helping the reader understand the purpose of the process. This is an example.
3.  Number each step in the process
4.  Begin each step with a verb. Optionally, conclude each step with a reason
    1.  e.g., Open the container with a vulnerable introduction to set a standard of trust and vulnerability for your peers
