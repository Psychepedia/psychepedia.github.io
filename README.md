# Synopsis

The Open Source Psychedelic Therapy Project is a freely available repository of evidence-based practices, guidelines, and resources for Psychedelic Assisted Therapy (PAT). It is designed for Journeyers (patients), Practitioners (guides, therapists, et al), and Operators (organizations) to safely and effectively leverage psychedelics in pursuit of healing and transformation.

The Project collects wisdom, research, and exercises from the most recent medical research to the most experienced shamans. The goal is to provide an objective, inclusive, and pragmatic approach that intersects science and spirituality, offering best-in-class information that is immediately accessible and useful. To this end, the Project is scoped as a process-driven series segmented as Preparation, Journey, and Integration (before, during, and after).
